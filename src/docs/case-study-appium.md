# Mobile Automation — SauceDemo

## 📋 Project Overview
This project provides automated end-to-end testing for the SauceDemo mobile app (Android).  
It focuses on essential flows such as login, cart management, context menu navigation, checkout process, and price validation.

---

## 🎯 Scope of the Project
Test coverage includes:
- User Authentication (Login)
- Shopping Cart Management
- Context Menu Navigation
- Complete Checkout Flow
- Price and Total Calculations

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Appium**
- **Cucumber (BDD)**
- **JUnit 5**
- **Java**
- **Allure Reports**

---

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced
Coming from a more traditional testing background, adapting to BDD with Cucumber required some adjustment, despite prior familiarity with Gherkin syntax.

---

## ✅ How These Challenges Were Addressed
I started by writing simple tests with plain JUnit and then gradually migrated them to the BDD format, which helped me better understand the structure and flow of Cucumber-based automation.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Complete End-to-End automation for mobile workflows.
- Allure Reports with **automatic screenshot capture** on failures.
- Data sharing between test steps.
- Use of best practices such as **Hooks**, **Page Object Model**, and **Context** handling.

## 📈 Outcome
A stable, maintainable mobile automation suite that covers key functionalities of the app.  
While slightly narrower in scope than the web version, the suite is easy to extend and adapt.

## 🔄 Lessons Learned & Future Improvements
- Deepened understanding of **BDD with Cucumber** and **Allure Reporting**.
- Future improvements may include better cross-device testing and CI integration.
