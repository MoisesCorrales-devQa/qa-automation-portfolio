# Selenium Web Automation — SauceDemo

## 📋 Project Overview
This project provides basic automated test coverage for the SauceDemo web application. While not aiming for exhaustive coverage, it focuses on verifying the core functionalities of the application.

---

## 🎯 Scope of the Project
The test suite covers the following key areas:
- User Authentication (Login)
- Product Inventory
- Shopping Cart
- Checkout Process
- Contextual (Side) Menu
- Navigation Flows

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Selenium WebDriver**
- **JUnit 5**
- **Java**
- **Allure Reports** (for advanced reporting)
- **Page Object Model** (design pattern for maintainability)

---

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced
The project did not involve particularly complex technical challenges.  
However, two aspects required thoughtful consideration:
- Structuring the End-to-End test scenarios.
- Clearly defining the scope and purpose of each test case.

---

## ✅ How These Challenges Were Addressed
Through careful analysis of the application's use cases, I clearly defined the test coverage for each feature and structured the test scenarios accordingly. This ensured maintainability and clarity throughout the suite.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Allure Reports with **automatic screenshot capture** on test failures.
- Implementation of **Page Object Model** for cleaner and reusable code.
- **Flexible configuration** via external files for easier adjustments.

## 🔄 Lessons Learned & Future Improvements
- Deepened my understanding of **Page Object Model** and test structure.
- Future enhancements may include:
  - Cross-browser testing (parallel runs).
  - Integration with Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines.
